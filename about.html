                <h1>About <span class="text-primary">OThulareSite</span></h1>
                <p>OThulare logistics refers to the flow of resources and information between a business or source and the consumer. It is a management process that analyzes how resources are acquired, stored and transported. To be effective, the process requires detailed analysis of a company’s entire supply chain.</p>
                <p>Effective management of the international supply chain process requires a strategy to effectively store and transport goods, services and related resources to the consumer. OThulare logistics analyzes and implements efficiencies to streamline this flow of resources from the point of origin to the point of consumption. It is a fundamental business process that includes the management of upstream and downstream relationships between suppliers and consumers.</p>

                <p>Just a quick note to say a very heartfelt THANK YOU for taking the time and walking me through this process! I was at wit’s end!! And had no where else to turn, all of these other freight companies had an OH WELL attitude. You were exactly the opposite. I hope that your company realizes what they have in you! Because of this, We have an IT Dept as well as another Bio-Med company. I will make sure that we use your company for all freight needs moving forward! Thank you to OT Logistics</p>
